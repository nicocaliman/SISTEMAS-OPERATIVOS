[1mNAME[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mfgetc[22m()  reads  the next character from [4mstream[24m and returns it as an [4mun‐[0m
       [4msigned[24m [4mchar[24m cast to an [4mint[24m, or [1mEOF [22mon end of file or error.

       [1mgetc[22m() is equivalent to [1mfgetc[22m() except that it may be implemented as  a
       macro which evaluates [4mstream[24m more than once.

       [1mgetchar[22m() is equivalent to [1mgetc([4m[22mstdin[24m[1m)[22m.

       [1mfgets[22m()  reads in at most one less than [4msize[24m characters from [4mstream[24m and
       stores them into the buffer pointed to by [4ms[24m.  Reading  stops  after  an
       [1mEOF  [22mor a newline.  If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer.
       A terminating null byte ('\0') is stored after the  last  character  in
       the buffer.

       [1mungetc[22m()  pushes  [4mc[24m  back to [4mstream[24m, cast to [4munsigned[24m [4mchar[24m, where it is
       available for subsequent read operations.  Pushed-back characters  will
       be returned in reverse order; only one pushback is guaranteed.

       Calls  to the functions described here can be mixed with each other and
       with calls to other input functions from the [4mstdio[24m library for the same
       input stream.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       [1mfgetc[22m(), [1mgetc[22m(), and [1mgetchar[22m() return the character read as an [4munsigned[0m
       [4mchar[24m cast to an [4mint[24m or [1mEOF [22mon end of file or error.

       [1mfgets[22m() returns [4ms[24m on success, and NULL on error or when end of file oc‐
       curs while no characters have been read.

       [1mungetc[22m() returns [4mc[24m on success, or [1mEOF [22mon error.

[1mNOTES[0m
       It  is not advisable to mix calls to input functions from the [4mstdio[24m li‐
       brary with low-level calls to [1mread[22m(2) for the file  descriptor  associ‐
       ated  with  the  input  stream;  the results will be undefined and very
       probably not what you want.
